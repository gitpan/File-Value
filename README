	File::Value MODULE AND snag SCRIPT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

OVERVIEW

The File::Value module supports the "snag" command.  The "snag" command
(script) creates previously non-existing file and directory names, and
comes with version-aware features for reporting the highest existing
version or creating the next higher version.


INSTALLATION

If not already unpacked, unpack the suite with

   tar xzf File-Value-0.20.tar.gz

after adjusting the version number as needed.  The current version is
known to pass build tests on Linux, Solaris, Mac, and Windows systems.

To install the module and script, run the following commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

For the "make install" you may have to become the superuser, as in,

   sudo make install
